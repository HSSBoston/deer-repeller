### Short Project Summary

This project builds an electronic deer repeller, called The Ultimate Deer Repeller (TUDR), to address a nuisance issue where wild deer damage home gardens. TUDR is an outdoor, in-garden system that distributes liquid repellent around garden plants with liquid pumps controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer. It runs a Python program that periodically contacts a cloud database and triggers repellent distribution. The databaseâ€™s data entry form allows gardeners to remotely set up and adjust the repellent distribution schedule with their smartphones, tablets, or web browsers.

This project was submitted to and presented at [AnimalHack 2023](https://AnimalHack.org). It won an [Honorable Mention](https://animalhack-2023.devpost.com/project-gallery).
